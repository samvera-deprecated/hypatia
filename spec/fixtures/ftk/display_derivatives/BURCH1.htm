<p>Chapter I: <u>The Iconography of an Expectation</u></p>

<p>A)  <u>A Prologue in Pictures</u></p>

<p>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh   upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in   you, and ye shall live (Ezekiel 37:6).</p>

<p>Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the Valley of Dry Bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons.  Charles R. Knight, most celebrated of all artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day.  In February, l942, Knight designed a chronological series of panoramas, depicting the history of life from the advent of multicellular animals to the triumph of <u>Homo</u> <u>sapiens</u>, for <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.  (This is the one issue that's always saved and therefore always missing when you see a &quot;complete&quot; run of the magazine on sale for two bits an issue on the back shelves of the general store in Bucolia, Maine.)  He based his first painting in the series -- the cover of this book -- on the animals of the Burgess Shale.</p>

<p>Without hesitation or ambiguity, and fully mindful of such paleontological wonders as large dinosaurs and African ape-men, I state that the invertebrates of the Burgess Shale, found high in the Canadian Rockies in Yoho National Park on the eastern border of British Columbia, are the world's most important animal fossils.  Modern multicellular animals make their first uncontested appearance in the fossil record some 570 million years ago -- and with a bang, not a protracted crescendo.  This &quot;Cambrian explosion&quot; marks the advent (at least into direct evidence) of virtually all major groups of modern animals -- and all within the minuscule span, geologically speaking, of a few million years.  The Burgess Shale represents a period just after this explosion, a time when the full range of its products inhabited our seas.  These Canadian fossils are precious because they preserve, in exquisite detail down to the last filament of a trilobite's gill, or the details of a last meal in a worm's gut, the soft anatomy of organisms.  Our fossil record is almost exclusively the story of hard parts.  But most animals have none; and those that do often reveal very little about their anatomies in their outer coverings (what could you infer about a clam from its shell alone).  Thus, the rare soft bodied faunas of the fossil record are precious windows into the true range and diversity of ancient life.  The Burgess Shale is our only extensive, well-documented window upon that most crucial event in the history of animal life -- the first flowering of the Cambrian explosion.</p>

<p>The Burgess Shale also presents a fascinating story in human terms.  The fauna was discovered in l909 by America's greatest paleontologist and scientific administrator, Charles Doolittle Walcott, Secretary (their name for boss) of the Smithsonian Institution.  Walcott proceeded to misinterpret these fossils in a comprehensive and thoroughly consistent manner proceeding directly from his conventional view of life.  In short, he shoehorned every last Burgess animal into a modern group, viewing the fauna collectively as a set of primitive or ancestral versions of later, improved forms.  Walcott's work was not consistently challenged for more than 50 years.  In l97l, Professor Harry Whittington of Cambridge University published the first monograph in a comprehensive reexamination that began with Walcott's presumptions and ended with a radical interpretation, not only for the Burgess Shale, but (by implication) for the entire history of life, including our own evolution.  </p>

<p>This book has three major aims.  It is, first and foremost, a chronicle of the intense intellectual drama behind the outward serenity of this reinterpretation.  Second, and by unavoidable implication, it is a statement about the nature of history and the awesome improbability of human evolution.  As a third theme, I grapple with the paradox of why such a fundamental program of research has been permitted to pass so invisibly before the public gaze.  Why is <u>Opabinia</u>, key animal in a new view of life, not a household name in all domiciles that care about the riddles of existence?</p>

<p>In short, Harry Whittington and his students have shown that most Burgess organisms do not belong to familiar groups, and that the creatures from this single quarry in British Columbia probably exceed, in anatomical range, the entire spectrum of invertebrate life in today's oceans.  Some l5 to 20 Burgess species cannot be allied with any known group, and should probably be classified as separate phyla.  Magnify some of them beyond the few centimeters of their actual size, and you are on the set of a science fiction film; one particularly arresting creature has been formally named <u>Hallucigenia</u>.  Within known groups, Burgess diversity far exceeds the modern range.  The Burgess Shale, for example, includes early representatives of all four major kinds of arthropods, the dominant animals on earth today -- the trilobites (now extinct), the crustaceans (including lobsters, crabs and shrimp), the chelicerates (including spiders and scorpions), and the uniramians (including insects).  But the Burgess Shale also contains some 20-30 different kinds of arthropods that cannot be placed into any modern group.  Consider the magnitude of this difference.  Taxonomists have described almost a million species of arthropods; all fit into four major groups.  One quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than 20 additional arthropod designs!  The history of life is a story of massive winnowing followed by differentiation within a few surviving stocks, not the conventional tale of steadily increasing excellence, complexity and diversity.</p>

<p>As an epitome of this new interpretation, compare Charles R. Knight's restoration of the Burgess fauna, based entirely on Walcott's version, with one that accompanied a recent article (l985) defending the reversed view.  </p>

<p>l.  The centerpiece of Knight's reconstruction is an animal named <u>Sidneyia</u>, largest of Burgess arthropods known  to Walcott, and an ancestral chelicerate in his view.  In the modern version, <u>Sidneyia</u> has been banished to the lower right, its place usurped by <u>Anomalocaris</u>, two foot terror of the Cambrian seas, and one of the Burgess &quot;unclassifiables.&quot;</p>

<p>2.  Knight restores each animal as a member of a well-known group that enjoyed substantial later success.  <u>Marrella</u> is reconstructed as a trilobite, <u>Waptia</u> as a proto-shrimp (see Figure l) -- though both are ranked among the unplaceable arthropods today.  The modern version features the unique Burgess phyla -- giant <u>Anomalocaris</u>, <u>Opabinia</u> with its five eyes and frontal &quot;nozzle,&quot; <u>Wiwaxia</u> with its covering of scales and two rows of dorsal spines (Figure 2).</p>

<p>3.  Knight's creatures obey the convention of the &quot;peaceable kingdom.&quot;  All are crowded together in an apparent harmony of mutual toleration; they do not interact.  The modern version retains this unrealistic crowding (a necessary tradition for      economy's sake), but features the ecological relations uncovered by recent research: priapulid and polychaete worms burrow in the mud; the mysterious <u>Aysheaia</u> grazes on sponges; <u>Anomalocaris</u> everts its jaw and crunches a trilobite.</p>

<p>4.  Consider <u>Anomalocaris</u> as a prototype for revision.  Knight includes two animals omitted from the modern reconstruction: jellyfishes in the upper right, and a curious arthropod, center left, composed of a shrimp's rear end covered in front by a bivalved shell.  Both are errors committed in the overzealous attempt to shoehorn Burgess animals into modern groups.  Walcott's &quot;jellyfish&quot; turns out to be the circlet of plates surrounding the mouth of <u>Anomalocaris</u>.  The posterior body of his &quot;shrimp&quot; is a feeding appendage of the same carnivorous beast.  Walcott's prototypes for two modern groups become body parts of the largest Burgess oddball, the appropriately named <u>Anomalocaris</u>.  </p>

<p>I thus begin by epitomizing a complex shift in ideas with an alteration in pictures.  Iconography is a neglected key to changing opinions, for the history and meaning of life in general, as well as for the Burgess shale in stark particulars.</p>

<p>B)  <u>The Ladder and the Cone: Iconographies of Progress</u></p>

<p>Familiarity has been breeding overtime in our mottoes -- producing everything from contempt (according to Aesop) to children (as Mark Twain observed).  Polonius, amidst his loquacious wanderings, urged Laertes to seek familiarity, while shunning vulgarity -- and then, having chosen well, to &quot;grapple&quot; the familiar &quot;to thy soul with hoops of steel.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet, as Polonius' eventual murderer stated in the most famous soliloquy of all time: &quot;ay, there's the rub.&quot;  Those hoops of steel are not easily unbound, and the comfortably familiar becomes a prison of thought.</p>

<p>Words are our favored medium of enforced consensus; nothing inspires orthodoxy and purposeful unanimity of action so well as a finely crafted motto -- win one for the Gipper, and God shed His grace on thee.  But our recent invention of speech cannot entirely bury an earlier heritage.  Primates are visual animals par excellence -- and the iconography of persuasion strikes even closer to the core of our being.  Every demagogue, every humorist, every advertizing executive has known and exploited the evocative power of a well chosen picture.</p>

<p>Scientists lost this insight somewhere along the way.  We use pictures more than most scholars, art historians excepted.  &quot;Next slide please&quot; even surpasses &quot;it seems to me that...&quot; as the most common phrase of professional talks at scientific meetings.  But our pictures are illustrations of what we defend by words.  Few scientists would view an image itself as intrinsically ideological in content.  Pictures, as accurate mirrors of nature, just are.</p>

<p>I can understand such an attitude directed towards photographs of objects -- though opportunities for subtle manipulation are legion even here.  But many of our figures are incarnations of concepts masquerading as neutral descriptions of nature.  These are the most potent sources of conformity, since ideas passing as descriptions lead us to equate the tentative with the unambiguously factual.  Suggestions for the organization of thought are transformed to established patterns in nature.  Guesses and hunches become things.</p>

<p>The familiar iconographies of evolution are all directed -- sometimes crudely, sometimes subtly -- towards reinforcing a comfortable view of human inevitability and superiority.  The starkest version, the chain of being or ladder of linear progress, has an ancient, pre-evolutionary pedigree (see A.O. Lovejoy's classic, <u>The Great Chain of Being</u>, l936):</p>

<p>Far as creation's ample range extends, </p>

<p>The scale of sensual, mental powers ascends:</p>

<p>Mark how it mounts to man's imperial race,</p>

<p>From the green myriads in the peopled grass</p>

<p>Alexander Pope, <u>Essay on Man</u></p>

<p>Consider a famous version from l799 (Figure 3).  In his <u>Regular Gradation in Man</u>, British physician Charles White shoehorned all the ramifying diversity of vertebrate life into a single motley sequence running from birds through crocodiles and dogs, past apes and up the conventional racist ladder of human groups to a Caucasian paragon, described with the rococo flourish of White's dying century. </p>

<p>Where shall we find, unless in the European, that nobly   arched head, containing such a quantity of brain...   Where the perpendicular face, the prominent nose, and   round projecting chin?  Where that variety of features,   and fullness of expression... those rosy cheeks and   coral lips?</p>

<p>This tradition never vanished, even in our more enlightened age.  In the l920's, Henry Fairfield Osborn celebrated the linear accretion of cognition in a figure full of illuminating errors.  Chimps are not ancestors (Figure 4), but modern cousins equally distant in evolutionary terms from the unknown forebear of African great apes and humans.  <u>Pithecanthropus</u> (<u>Homo</u> <u>erectus</u> in modern terms) is a potential ancestor, and only legitimate member of the sequence.  The inclusion of Piltdown is especially revealing.  We now know that Piltdown was a fraud composed of a modern human cranium and an ape's jaw.  As a contemporary skull, Piltdown possessed a brain of modern size; yet so convinced were Osborn's colleagues that human fossils must show intermediate values on a ladder of progress, that they reconstructed Piltdown's skull according to their expectations.  As for Neanderthal, these creatures were probably close cousins belonging to a separate species, not ancestors.  In any case, they had brains as large or larger than ours, Osborn's ladder notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Nor have we abandoned this iconography in our generation.</p>

<p>Consider Figure 5, from one of the best and most popular of modern textbooks (Campbell, l976).  The march of progress, single file, could not be more graphic.  We descend from the trees and begin our upward journey to larger size, bigger brains, less hairy bodies, and more erect gait.  Smooth intermediacy is forced upon recalcitrant data.  Our australopithecine ancestors are reconstructed as stoop-shouldered, though we have known for fifty years that they probably walked as erect as you or I.  Moreover, lest we think that only Western culture promotes this conceit, I present one illustration of its spread (Figure 6), purchased at the bazaar of Agra in l985.  </p>

<p>The &quot;march of progress&quot; as <u>the</u> canonical representation of evolution -- the one picture immediately grasped and viscerally understood by all -- may best be appreciated by its prominent use in humor and advertising.  These professions provide our best test of public perceptions.  Jokes and ads must &quot;click&quot; in the fleeting second that our attention grants them.  Consider Figure 7, drawn by Larry Johnson for the Boston Globe, before a recent Patriots-Raiders football game.  Or Figure 8 by the cartoonist Szep, on the proper place of terrorism; or Figure 9, on &quot;scientific creationism.&quot;  Or Figure l0 by my friend Mike Peters, on social possibilities traditionally open to men and women.  For advertising, consider the evolution of Guiness (Figure ll) or of rental television (Figure l2). </p>

<p>The straightjacket of linear advance goes beyond iconography to the definition of evolution.  The word itself becomes a synonym for progress!  The makers of Doral cigarettes once presented a linear sequence of &quot;improved&quot; products through the years, all under the heading &quot;Doral's theory of evolution.&quot;  (Perhaps they are now embarrassed by this misguided claim, since they refused me permission to reprint the ad.)  Or consider Figure l3 from Andy Capp.  Flo has no problem with evolution, but she defines it as progress, and views Andy's quadrupedal homecoming as something different, and in reverse.</p>

<p>Life is a copiously branching bush, continually pruned by the grim reaper of extinction, not a ladder of predictable progress.  Most people may know this as a phrase to be uttered, but not as a concept brought into the deep interior of understanding.  Thus we continually make errors inspired by unconscious allegiance to the ladder of progress, even when we explicitly deny such a superannuated view of life.  Consider two examples, the second providing a key to our conventional misunderstanding of the Burgess Shale.</p>

<p>First, in an error that I call &quot;life's little joke&quot; (Gould, l987), we are virtually compelled to the stunning mistake of citing unsuccessful lineages as classic &quot;textbook&quot; cases of &quot;evolution.&quot;  We do this because we try to extract a single line of advance from the true topology of copious branching.  In this misguided effort, we are inevitably drawn to bushes so near the brink of total annihilation that they contain only one surviving twig.  We then view this twig as the acme of upward achievement, rather than the probable last gasp of a richer ancestry.  </p>

<p>Consider the great warhorse of tradition -- the evolutionary ladder of horses themselves (Figure l4).  To be sure, an unbroken evolutionary connection does link <u>Hyracotherium</u> (&quot;<u>Eohippus</u>&quot;) to modern <u>Equus</u>.  And, yes again, modern horses are bigger, with fewer toes and higher crowned teeth.  But <u>Hyracotherium</u>-<u>Equus</u> is not a ladder, or even a central lineage.  This sequence is but one labyrinthine pathway among thousands in a complex bush.  This particular route has achieved its prominence for one ironic reason alone -- because all other twigs are extinct.  <u>Equus</u> is the only branch left, hence the tip of a ladder in our false iconography.  Horses became the classic case of progressive evolution because their bush has been so unsuccessful.  We never grant proper acclaim to the real triumphs of mammalian evolution. Who has ever heard a story about the evolution of bats, antelopes, or rodents -- though they are the current champions of mammalian life.  We tell no such tales because we cannot linearize the bounteous success of these creatures into our favored ladder.  They present us with thousands of twigs on a vigorous bush.</p>

<p>Need I remind everyone that at least one other lineage of mammals, especially dear to our hearts for parochial reasons, shares with horses both the proper topology of a bush with one surviving twig, and the false iconography of a march to progress.</p>

<p>As a second great error, we may abandon the ladder and acknowledge the branching character of evolutionary lineages, yet still portray the tree of life in a conventional manner chosen to validate our hopes for predictable progress.</p>

<p>The tree of life grows with a few crucial constraints upon its form.  First, since any well-defined taxonomic group can trace its origin to a single common ancestor, evolutionary trees must have a unique basal trunk.  Second, all branches of the tree either die or ramify further.  Separation is irrevocable; distinct branches do not join.</p>

<p>Yet, within these constraints of <u>monophyly</u> and <u>divergence</u>, the geometric possibilities for evolutionary trees are nearly endless.  A bush might quickly expand to maximal width and then taper continuously, like a Christmas tree.  Or it might diversify rapidly, but then maintain its full width by a continuing balance of origin and death.  Or it might, like a tumbleweed, branch helter-skelter in a confusing jumble of shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>Ignoring these multifarious possibilities, conventional iconography has fastened upon a primary model, the &quot;cone of increasing diversity,&quot; or Christmas tree in reverse.  Life begins with the restricted and simple, progressing ever upward to more and more and, by implication, better and better.  Figure l5 on the evolution of coelomate animals (the subject of this book), shows the orderly origin of everything from a simple flatworm.  The stem splits to a few basic stocks; none become extinct, and each diversifies further to a continually increasing number of subgroups.  </p>

<p>I present, as Figure l6, a panoply of cones drawn from popular modern textbooks -- three abstract and three actual examples for groups crucial to the argument of this book.  (In Chapter 3, I shall discuss the origin of this model in Haeckel's original trees and their influence upon Walcott's great error in reconstructing the Burgess fauna.)  All these trees show the same pattern: branches split, while growing ever upward and outward.  If some early lineages die, later gains soon overbalance any loss.  Early deaths can only eliminate small branches near the central trunk.  Evolution unfolds as though the tree were growing up a funnel, always filling the continually expanding cone of possibilities. </p>

<p>The cone of diversity propagates an interesting conflation of meaning in its conventional interpretation.  The horizontal dimension is diversity -- fishes plus insects plus snails plus starfishes at the top take up much more lateral room than just flatworms at the bottom.  But what does the vertical dimension represent?  In a literal reading, up and down should only record younger and older in geological time -- the neck of the funnel is ancient, the lip recent.  But we also read vertical movement as simple to complex, or primitive to advanced.  <u>Placement in time is conflated with judgment of worth</u>.</p>

<p>Our ordinary discourse about animals follows this iconography.  Nature's theme is diversity.  We live surrounded by coeval twigs of life's tree.  In Darwin's world, all (as survivors in a tough game) have some claim to equal status.  Why, then, do we usually choose to construct a ranking of implied worth (by assumed complexity, or relative nearness to humans, for example)?  In a recent review of a book on courtship in the animal kingdom, Jonathan Weiner (<u>New York Times Book Review</u>, March 27, l988) describes the author's scheme of organization: &quot;Working in loosely evolutionary order, Mr. Walters begins with horseshoe crabs, which have been meeting and mating on dark beaches in synchrony with tide and moon for 200 million years.&quot;  Later chapters make the &quot;long evolutionary leap to the antics of the pygmy chimpanzee.&quot;  Why is this sequence called &quot;evolutionary order&quot;?  Anatomically complex horseshoe crabs are not ancestral to vertebrates; the two phyla, Arthropoda and Chordata, have been separate from the very first records of multicellular life.  </p>

<p>In another recent example, and to show that this error infests technical as well as lay discourse, an editorial in <u>Science</u>, the leading professional journal in America, constructs an order every bit as motley and senseless as White's &quot;regular gradation&quot; (Figure 3).  Commenting on species commonly used for laboratory work, the editors discuss the &quot;middle range&quot; between unicellular creatures and guess who at the apex: &quot;Higher on the evolutionary ladder,&quot; we learn, &quot;the nematode, the fly and the frog have the advantage of complexity beyond the single cell, but represent far simpler species than mammals&quot; (June l0, l988).</p>

<p>The fatuous idea of a single order amidst the multifarious diversity of modern life flows from our conventional iconographies and the prejudices that nurture them -- the ladder of life and the cone of increasing diversity.  By the ladder, horseshoe crabs are judged as simple; by the cone, they are deemed old.  And one implies the other under the grand conflation discussed above -- down on the ladder also means old, while low on the cone denotes simple.</p>

<p>I don't think that any particular secret, mystery or inordinate subtlety underlies the reasons for our allegiance to these false iconographies of ladders and cones.  They are chosen because they nurture our hopes for a universe of intrinsic meaning defined in our terms.  We simply cannot bear the implications of Omar Khayyam's honesty:</p>

<p>Into this Universe, and Why not knowing,</p>

<p>Nor whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing:</p>

<p>    And out of it, as Wind along the Waste</p>

<p>I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing.</p>

<p>A later quatrain of the Rubaiyat proposes a counteracting strategy, but acknowledges its status as a vain hope:</p>

<p>Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire</p>

<p>To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,</p>

<p>Would we not shatter it to bits -- and then</p>

<p>Re-mold it nearer to the Heart's Desire!</p>

<p>Most myths and early scientific explanations of Western culture pay homage to this &quot;heart's desire.&quot;  Consider the primal tale of Genesis -- a world but a few thousand years old, inhabited by humans for all but the first five days, and populated by creatures made for our benefit and subordinate to our needs.  Such a geological background could inspire Alexander Pope's confidence about the deeper meaning of immediate appearances:</p>

<p>All nature is but art, unknown to thee;</p>

<p>All chance, direction which thou canst not see;</p>

<p>All discord, harmony not understood;</p>

<p>All partial evil, universal good.</p>

<p>But, as Freud observed, our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power -- the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing marginality in an uncaring universe.  Thus, physics and astronomy relegated our home to a corner of the cosmos, and biology shifted our status from a simulacrum of God to a naked, upright ape.</p>

<p>My profession contributed its own special shock to this cosmic redefinition -- geology's most frightening fact, we might say.  By the turn of the last century, we knew that the earth had endured for millions of years, and that human existence occupied but the last geological millimicrosecond of this history -- the last inch of the cosmic mile, or the last second of the geological year, in our standard pedagogical metaphors.</p>

<p>We cannot bear the central implication of this brave new world.  If we arose just yesterday as a small twig on one branch of a flourishing tree, then life may not, in any genuine sense, exist for or because of us.  Perhaps we are only an afterthought, a kind of cosmic accident, just one bauble on the Christmas tree of evolution.</p>

<p>What options are left in the face of geology's most frightening fact?  Only two, really.  We may, as this book advocates, accept the implications and learn to seek the meaning of human life, including the source of morality, in other, more appropriate domains -- either stoically with a sense of loss, or with joy in the challenge if our temperament be optimistic.  Or we may continue to seek cosmic comfort in nature by reading history in a distorted light.</p>

<p>If we elect the second strategy, our maneuvers are severely restricted by our geological history.  When we infested all but the first five days of time, the history of life could easily be rendered in our terms.  But if we wish to assert human centrality in a world that functioned without us until the last moment, we must somehow grasp all that came before as a grand preparation --a foreshadowing of our eventual origin.  </p>

<p>The old chain of being would provide greatest comfort, but we now know that the vast majority of &quot;simpler&quot; creatures are not human ancestors or even prototypes, but only collateral branches on life's tree.  The cone of increasing progress and diversity therefore becomes our iconography of choice.  The cone implies predictable development from simple to complex, from less to more.  <u>Homo</u> <u>sapiens</u> may only form a twig, but if life moves, even fitfully, towards greater complexity and higher mentality, then the eventual origin of self-conscious intelligence may be implicit in all that came before.  In short, I cannot understand our continued allegiance to manifestly false iconographies of ladder and cone except as a last finger in the dike of cosmically justified hope and arrogance.</p>

<p>I leave the last word on this subject to Mark Twain, who grasped so graphically, when the Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest building, the implications of geology's most frightening fact.</p>

<p>Man has been here 32,000 years.  That it took a hundred   million years to prepare the world for him is proof   that that is what it was done for.  I suppose it is.  I   dunno.  If the Eiffel Tower were now representing the   world's age, the skin of paint on the pinnacle knob at   its summit would represent man's share of that age; and   anybody would perceive that the skin was what the tower   was built for. I reckon they would, I dunno.   </p>

<p>C)  <u>Replaying Life's Tape: The Crucial Experiment</u></p>

<p>The iconography of the cone forces Walcott's original interpretation of the Burgess Shale.  Any fauna so close to the origin of multicellular life must lie in the neck of the funnel.  Burgess animals therefore cannot stray beyond a strictly limited range of disparity, and a basic simplicity of anatomy.  They must, in short, be classified either as primitive designs within modern groups, or as ancestral animals that might, with increased complexity, progress to some familiar form of modern seas.  Small wonder, then, that Walcott interpreted every organism in the Burgess Shale as a primitive member of a prominent branch on life's later tree.</p>

<p>I know no greater challenge to the iconography of the cone </p>

<p>-- hence no more important case for a fundamentally revised view of life -- than the radical reconstructions of Burgess anatomy presented by Whittington and his colleagues.  They have literally followed our most venerable metaphor for revolution -- they have turned the traditional interpretation on its head.  By illustrating so many unique anatomies in the Burgess, and by showing that familiar groups were then experimenting with designs so far beyond the modern range, they have inverted the cone.  The sweep of anatomical design reached a maximum right after the initial diversification of multicellular animals.  The later history of life proceeds by winnowing, not expansion.  The current earth may hold more species than ever before, but most are iterations upon a few basic anatomical designs.  (Taxonomists have described more than a half million species of beetles, but nearly all are minimally altered xeroxes of a single ground plan.)  In fact, the probable increase in number of species through time merely underscores the puzzle and paradox.  Compared with the Burgess seas, today's oceans contain many more species based upon many fewer anatomical plans.  </p>

<p>Figure l7 presents a revised iconography reflecting the lessons of the Burgess Shale.  The maximum range of anatomical possibilities arises with the first rush of diversification.  Later history is a tale of restriction, as most of these early experiments succumb, while later life settles down to generating endless variants upon a few surviving models.</p>

<p>This inverted iconography, however interesting and radical in itself, need not imply a revised view of evolutionary predictability and direction.  For we can abandon the cone and accept the iconography of winnowing, while maintaining full allegiance to tradition with the following interpretation: life may be winnowed to just a few percent of Burgess possibilities, but the losers were chaff, and predictably doomed.  Survivors won for cause -- and cause includes a crucial edge in anatomical, complexity and competitive ability.</p>

<p>But the Burgess pattern of winnowing also suggests a truly radical alternative, precluded by the iconography of the cone.  Suppose that winners do not prevail for cause in the usual sense.  Perhaps the grim reaper is only Lady Luck in drag.  Or perhaps the usual reasons for survival do not support conventional ideas of cause as complexity, improvement, or anything moving at all human-ward.  Perhaps the grim reaper of anatomical designs works during brief episodes of mass extinction, provoked by unpredictable environmental catastrophes (often triggered by impacts of extraterrestrial bodies).  Groups may prevail or die</p>

<p>BOX:  I. Definitions of Diversity</p>

<p>I must introduce, at this point, an important distinction that should allay a classic source of confusion in such discussions.  Biologists use the vernacular term &quot;diversity&quot; in several different technical senses.  They may talk about &quot;diversity&quot; as number of distinct species.  Among mammals, rodent diversity is high by virtue of more than l500 separate species; horse diversity is low, since zebras, donkeys and true horses come in fewer than l0 species.  But biologists also speak of &quot;diversity&quot; as difference in body plans.  Three blind mice (of differing species) do not make a diverse fauna, but an elephant, a tree and an ant do -- even though each assemblage contains just three species.</p>

<p>The revision of the Burgess Shale rests upon diversity in this second sense of <u>disparity</u> in anatomical plans.  Burgess diversity, measured as number of species, is not high.  This fact, as suggested above, expresses a central paradox of early life.  How could so much disparity in body plans be evolved in the apparent absence of substantial diversity in number of species -- for the two are correlated, more or less in lockstep, by the iconography of the cone (Figure l6).</p>

<p>Thus, when I speak of &quot;winnowing,&quot; I refer to reduction in anatomical designs for life, not numbers of species.  Most paleontologists agree that the simple count of species has augmented through time (Sepkoski <u>et</u> <u>al</u>., l98l) -- and this increase of species must therefore occur <u>within</u> a reduced number of body plans.  </p>

<p>Most people do not fully appreciate the stereotyped character of current life.  We learn lists of odd phyla in high school -- until kinorhynch, priapulid, gnathostomulid and pogonophoran roll off the tongue (at least until the examination ends).  By focussing on a few oddballs, we forget how unbalanced life can be.  Nearly 80 percent of all described animal species are arthropods (mostly insects).  On the sea floor, once you enumerate polychaete worms, sea urchins, crabs and snails, there aren't that many coelomate invertebrates left.  Stereotypy, or the cramming of most species into a few anatomical plans, is a cardinal feature of modern life -- and its greatest difference from the world of Burgess times. </p>

<p>Several of my colleagues (Jaanusson, l98l; Runnegar, l987)   have suggested that we eliminate the confusion about diversity by restricting this vernacular term to the first sense, or number of species.  The second meaning of differences in anatomical designs should then be called &quot;disparity.&quot;  Using this terminology, we may acknowledge a central and surprising fact of life's history -- marked decrease in disparity followed by an outstanding increase in diversity within the few surviving designs.</p>

<p>for reasons that bear no relationship to the Darwinian basis of success in normal times.  Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up.  But grubby old Buster the Lungfish, former laughing stock of the piscine priesthood, might pull through -- and not because a bunion on his great grandfather's fin warned his ancestors about an impending comet.  Buster and his kin may prevail because a feature, evolved long ago for a different use, fortuitously permitted survival through a sudden and unpredictable change in rules.  And if we are Buster's legacy, and the result of a thousand other similarly happy accidents, how can we possibly view mentality as inevitable, or even probable?</p>

<p>We live, as our humorists proclaim, in a world of good news and bad news.  The good news is that we can specify an experiment to decide between the conventional and radical interpretations of winnowing, thereby settling the most important question we can ask about the history of life.  The bad news is that we can't possibly perform the experiment.  </p>

<p>I call this experiment &quot;replaying life's tape.&quot;  You press the rewind button and, making sure you thoroughly erase everything that actually happened, go back to any time in the past -- say the seas of the Burgess Shale.  Then let the tape run again and see if the repetition looks at all like the original.  If each replay strongly resembles life's actual pathway, then we must conclude that what really happened pretty much had to occur.  But suppose that the experimental versions all yield sensible results strikingly different from the actual history of life?  What could we then say about the predictability of self-conscious intelligence? or of mammals? or of vertebrates?  or of life on land? or simply of multicellular persistence for 600 million difficult years?</p>

<p>We can now appreciate the central importance of the Burgess revision, and its iconography of winnowing.  Under the ladder or cone, the issue of life's tape does not arise.  The ladder has but one bottom rung, and one direction.  Reply the tape forever, and eohippus always gallops into the sunrise, bearing its larger body on fewer toes.  The cone has a narrow neck and a restricted range of upward movement.  Rewind the tape back into the neck of time, and you always obtain the same prototypes, constrained to rise in the same general direction.</p>

<p>But if a radical winnowing of a much greater range of initial possibilities set the pattern of later life, including the chance of our own origin, then consider the alternatives.  Suppose that ten of a hundred designs will survive and diversify?  If the ten survivors are predictable by superiority of anatomy (interpretation one), then they win each time -- and Burgess winnowing does not challenge our comforting view of life.  But if the ten survivors are protegés of Lady Luck or fortunate beneficiaries of odd historical contingencies (interpretation two), then each replay of the tape yields a different set of survivors, and a radically different history.  And if you recall how to calculate permutations and combinations from high-school algebra, you will remember that the total number of combinations for l0 items from a pool of l00 yields more than l7 trillion potential outcomes. I am willing to grant that some groups might have enjoyed a predictable edge (though we have no idea how to identify or define them), but I suspect that the second interpretation grasps a central truth about evolution.  The Burgess Shale, in making this second interpretation intelligible by the hypothetical experiment of the tape, promotes a radical view of evolutionary pathways and predictability.</p>

<p>The rejection of cone and ladder does not throw us into the arms of a supposed opposite -- pure chance in the sense of coin tossing, or God playing dice with the universe.  Just as the cone and ladder are limiting iconographies for life's history, so too does the very idea of dichotomy grievously restrict our thinking.  Dichotomy has its own unfortunate iconography -- a single line embracing all possible opinions, with the two ends representing polar opposites, determinism and randomness in this case.</p>

<p>An old tradition, dating at least to Aristotle, advises the prudent person to stake out a position comfortably towards the middle of the line -- the <u>aurea</u> <u>mediocritas</u> (or golden mean).  But, in this case, the middle of the line has not been so happy a place, and the game of dichotomy has seriously hampered our thinking about the history of life.  We may understand that the older determinism of predictable progress cannot strictly apply, but we think that our only alternative lies with the despair of pure randomness.  So we are driven back towards the old view, and finish with discomfort at some ill-defined confusion in between.</p>

<p>I strongly reject any vision that places our options on a line, and holds that the only alternative to a pair of extreme positions lies somewhere between them.  More fruitful perspectives often require that we step off the line to a site outside the dichotomy.</p>

<p>I write this book to suggest a third attitude off the line.  I believe that the Burgess revision, interpreted through the theme of replaying life's tape, offers powerful support for this different view of life.  In short, any replay of the tape would lead evolution down a pathway radically different from the road actually taken.  But these differences in outcome do not imply that evolution is senseless, and without meaningful pattern.  The divergent route of the replay would be just as interpretable, just as explainable <u>after</u> the fact, as the actual road.  But the diversity of possible itineraries does demonstrate that eventual results cannot be predicted at the outset.  Each step proceeds for cause, but no finale can be specified at the start, and none would ever occur a second time in the same way, because any pathway proceeds through thousands of improbable stages.  Alter any early event, ever so slightly and without apparent importance at the time, and evolution cascades into a radically different channel.</p>

<p>This third attitude has a name.  It represents no more nor less than the essence of history.  Its watchword is contingency</p>

<p>-- and contingency is a thing unto itself, not the titration of determinism by randomness.  Science has been slow to admit the different explanatory world of history into its domain -- and our interpretations have suffered in poverty for this omission.  Science has also tended to denigrate history, when forced to a confrontation, by regarding any invocation of contingency as less elegant or less meaningful than explanations based directly on timeless &quot;laws of nature.&quot;</p>

<p>This book is about the nature of history, and the overwhelming improbability of human evolution under themes of contingency and the metaphor of replaying life's tape.  It focusses upon the new interpretation of the Burgess Shale as our finest illustration of what contingency implies in our quest to understand the evolution of life.</p>

<p>I concentrate upon details of the Burgess Shale because I don't believe that important concepts should be discussed tendentiously in the abstract (much as I have disobeyed the rule in this opening chapter!)  People, as curious primates, dote on concrete objects that can be seen and fondled.  God dwells among the details, not in the realm of pure generality.  We must tackle and grasp the larger, encompassing themes of our universe, but we make our best approach through small curiosities that rivet out attention -- all those pretty pebbles on the shoreline of knowledge.  For the ocean of truth washes over the pebbles with every wave -- and they rattle and clink with the most wondrous din.</p>

<p>We can argue about abstract ideas forever.  We can posture and feint.  We may &quot;prove&quot; to the satisfaction of one generation, only to become the laughing stock of a later century (or, worse still, to be utterly forgotten).  We may even validate an idea by grafting it permanently upon an object of nature -- thus participating in the legitimate sense of a great human adventure called &quot;progress in scientific thought.&quot;</p>

<p>But the animals of the Burgess Shale are somehow even more satisfying in their adamantine factuality.  We will argue forever about the meaning of life, but <u>Opabinia</u> either did or did not have five eyes -- and we can know for certain one way or the other.  The animals of the Burgess Shale are also the world's most important fossils, in part because they have revised our view of life, but also because they are objects of such exquisite beauty.  Their loveliness lies as much in the breadth of ideas that they embody, and in the magnitude of our struggle to interpret their anatomy, as in their elegance of form and preservation.</p>

<p>The animals of the Burgess Shale are holy objects -- in the unconventional sense that this word conveys in some cultures.  We do not place them on pedestals and worship from afar.  We climb mountains and dynamite hillsides to find them.  We quarry them, split them, carve them, draw them, and dissect them, struggling to wrest their secrets.  We vilify and curse them for their dam- nable intransigence.  They are grubby little creatures of a sea floor 530 million years old, but we greet them with awe because they are the Old Ones, and they are trying to tell us something.</p>
